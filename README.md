## MCAN Ennovate App
This is a eye protection app which clicks photos every X seconds.
It then uses mlvision on the photo to find the face details. 
We have some values for difference between position of left eye and right eye for finding whether face is close or not. 
If it finds that face is too close it displays a message saying that your face is too close, back off. 
This app works in background so it runs over other apps
